# Build instructions

Work in master gets published to the `gh-pages` branch of the same repository.
To make this process easier, you can run the `publish.sh` script from the root directory.

This will compile the static files into an output directory,
commit that output directory as the new gh-pages branch and
push changes to github. Any tweaks to the routine should be handled by the 
`publish.sh` script
