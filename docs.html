The Strategic Growth Policy (SGP), a product of the Refuge System's vision outlined in Conserving the Future, is in place to ensure that the Refuge System identifies the most important and valuable landscapes in which to protect land. These decisions must be based on the biological priorities of recovering, threatened, and endangered species; implementing population objective from the North American Waterfowl Management Plan; and conserving birds of conservation concern. Because the opportunities to grow the refuge system far exceed the funds and time to do so, the Refuge System needs to be more strategic in identifying landscapes that offer the greatest return on our conservation investment.

The Refuge System can no longer afford to solely manage isolated, small patches on the landscape to protect our trust resources. Twenty first century conservation challenges require that the Refuge landscape consist of USFWS fee-acquired lands as core areas, easements as buffer or connectivity zones, and the efforts of a significant private-public partnership to focus on associated key areas of the landscape. The landscapes of the refuge system will be those areas where we meet our goals and objectives in an efficient way. Not all landscapes require the same level of investment. Just as there are core areas, there are also core landscapes: regions in the US that are irreplaceable and have a high return on conservation investment. These are the areas where the Refuge System needs to engage and provide leadership in Landscape Conservation Design (LCD). How do we systematically identify those priority areas that will have the broadest benefit to the resources we are entrusted to protect? The Priority Landscape Conservation Investment Tool (PLCIT) is one tool that can inform that question at a landscape scale.
